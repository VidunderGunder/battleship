# React Battleship

Portfolio project/interview task (unfinished - I took another job ðŸ˜‡)

Task in hand:

> Based on the rules of the Battleship board game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) implement a program that randomly places ships on two boards and simulates the gameplay between 2 players.
> 
> I understand that this is a very open-ended task, and that you might have many questions, but I encourage you to make reasonable assumptions. There is also no deadline for this, but I believe that delivering in 2-3 days would ensure that you don't spend too much time on it!
> 
> Happy coding - and looking forward to the delivery.
